In this project, I created a custom VPC and launched instances in order to test my VPC. In the VPC there is a CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, 
two private subnets and two public subnets across two availability zones. Also there is an internet gateways, a main route table, and a private route table. 
This would have allowed me to attatch a NAT gateway in the future to allow outbound internet activity.

Here how I created and configured the VPC:
# Create VPC
Name: MyVPC
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16

# Create Public Subnets

Name: Public-1A
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/24

Name: Public-1B
Availability Zone: us-east-1b
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.2.0/24

Name: Private-1A
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.3.0/24

Name: Private-1B
Availability Zone: us-east-1b
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.4.0/24

# Create private route table

Name: Private-RT
VPC: MyVPC
Subnet associations: Private-1A, Private-1B

# Create Internet Gateway

Name: MyIGW
VPC: MyVPC

Once my private route table was created, I associated both of the private subnets. Then lastly I created an internet gateway and attatched it to MyVPC.
I also attatched the internet gateway to the main route table.

I then launch an amazon linux t2.micro instance in order to test my VPC out. I added HTTP and SSH in bound rules to my security groups to this instance.

I also added this bit of code to the user data to install a web server:

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

Then I created a second instance to test the private subnet, and confirgure my security group for SSH and ICMP - IPv4.

To test the public subnet I copied the IP address to my browser, below are the results:
