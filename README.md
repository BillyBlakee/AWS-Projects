## Overview
Welocme to my AWS projects repository. This is where I try to get more hands on experience with cloud computing. AWS offers so many services and I want to try and implement some of them in a cost effective, reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use way.

In my repository, some of the projects will be very simple. I will make them more complex and advance as I go along.
