# Overview
Welcome to my collection of AWS (Amazon Web Services) projects! This repository serves as a showcase and resource for various applications and solutions I've developed using AWS, the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

### What's Inside
Each project in this repository demonstrates practical use cases of AWS services, ranging from computing and storage to machine learning and data analytics.

### Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of this repository is to provide real-world examples of cloud-based solutions using AWS. By sharing these projects, I aim to continue to learn about cloud computing by getting hands on experience and testing out many of AWS services on my own.
